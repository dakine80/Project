    "The goal of my project is to create an electronic Help Monitor (I gave the monitor the name 'Dallon') within the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport through the use of an interactive chatbot. The Help Monitor is designed to be used once you get pass security and are in a terminal within the airport. The user is presented with 5 different questions associated with different subsets of information - terminal and gate of flight, departure time of flight, duration of flight, departure time of delayed flight, and restaurants within the terminal of your flight. To access the first 4 subsets of information presented from top to bottom on the monitor, users must input their flight number (which can be theoretically accessed through their flight ticket and is found in a list in my code). To access the subset of information from the 5th option, users must input their terminal (a capital letter which can be found by using the first option and through a list in my code).\n",
    "\n",
    "Terminal and gate of flight are outputted together as the numbers associated with the gates are mostly the same within each terminal, so you need to have a terminal associated with the gate number to know where to go specifically. If you use the departure time option and your flight is delayed, you will be directed to the delayed time option where you can see your new departure time. This Help Monitor is designed to be a simple way to access useful information. Please run the code to access the chatbot!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Terminals and gates are consistent with the actual Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, but the restaurants are not. "
